Please carefully read this Copyright Policy (“Copyright Policy”), which is a legally binding supplement to our Terms of Use, which you have already accepted by using the Services, and which this Copyright Policy incorporates by reference. Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.

It is the policy of the Loudr® to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable intellectual property laws (collectively the "Act"). This page lists our requirements under the Act for notice of copyright infringement and for responses to such a notice if you or your materials are flagged.

We have appointed and registered Ryland Hale as our copyright agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement and have informed the United States Copyright Office of this appointment.

Please refer to the following address, phone number, and e-mail address for all claims:

re:discover, Inc., d/b/a Loudr®
Attn. Ryland Hale, Copyright Agent
4002 26th St.
San Francisco, CA. 94131
E-Mail: copyright@loudr.fm
As explained in more detail below, the Act requires the removal or disabling of access to content claimed to be, or reasonably determined by Company to be, the subject of infringing activity. If the Act requires content to be removed from any of our Services, we will remove the content.

Notice of Copyright Infringement

If you believe that content on any of our Services violates any of your exclusive rights under United States Copyright Law, you must send a written communication to our Copyright Agent at the contact above. The written communication should include the following:

Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed, along with reasonably sufficient information to permit us to locate the material.
Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as address, telephone number and, if available, an e-mail address.
A physical or, in the event of a PDF submission, an electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
The following statement: "I have a good faith belief that the use of materials described above is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law."
The following statement: "The information in this notification is accurate and that I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
We have no other role to play, either in prosecuting or defending claims of infringement, and cannot be held accountable in any case for damages, regardless of whether a claim of infringement is found to be true or false. Pursuant to the Act, you may be liable for damages, including court costs and attorneys fees, if you misrepresent that a product or activity is infringing your copyrights. If you are not sure whether material on our Services infringes your copyright, we urge you to first consult an attorney.

Upon receipt of a notice of infringement made in accordance with our Copyright Policy, we will respond expeditiously and remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity as required by the Act. Our Copyright Agent will take reasonable steps to promptly notify the affected party or parties.

Counter-Notice

If we have removed your content from our Services due to suspicion of copyright infringement, we will notify you at the email address provided in your User Account, and you may dispute the alleged infringement by responding to the message within two (2) business days of receiving the notice. That written response should include the following:

Identification of the content to which access has been disabled or that has been removed from Services.
Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, including at a minimum address, telephone number and a valid e-mail address.
A physical or electronic signature from you or from a person authorized to act on your behalf.
The following statement: "Under penalty of perjury, I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
The following statement: "The information in this notification is accurate, and I swear, in good faith and under penalty of perjury, that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
The following statement: "I consent to the jurisdiction of San Francisco for the judicial district in which such address is located, and will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of copyright infringement or an agent of such person."
If you have served a counter notification complying with the above requirements, please note that we will promptly provide the person who provided the initial infringement statement with a copy of the counter notification, as well as your contact information, and will inform such person that Loudr will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days. We will then replace the removed material and cease disabling access to within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless the copyright owner delivers to our Copyright Agent notice that it has filed an action seeking a court order. If we receive a notification from a copyright holder who has procured an enforceable injunction prohibiting our Loudr from providing access to allegedly infringing material, we will follow the requirements of the injunction.

Other Types of Infringement

The policies and processes outlined above apply to copyright claims only. If you discover any content that you believe to be in infringement of any other intellectual property rights or in violation of our policies, please contact legal@loudr.fm.

Revision

We may revise our Copyright Policy from time to time in accordance with the policies set forth in our Terms of Use.
