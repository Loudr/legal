<h3 class=""heading heading-content"">Acceptance Of The Agreement </h3>

<p>Please carefully read the following agreement (“Music Services Agreement” or “Agreement”), which creates a legally binding, enforceable contract between you and re:discover, Inc. regarding your use of our music services, collectively referred to herein as Loudr (“Loudr”), including our content licensing and digital distribution services, regardless whether accessed through the Loudr Website located at <a href=""http://www.loudr.fm/"">www.loudr.fm</a> or a third-party platform. Throughout this Agreement, “Company” “us” “our” and “we” refers to re:discover, Inc. and its affiliates; and “you” or “Content Owner” refers to you, the content owner — anyone who uses our content licensing and digital distribution services. The terms of this Agreement supplement our Terms of Use, Copyright Policy and Privacy Policy, located at <a href=""http://www.loudr.fm/legal"">www.loudr.fm/legal</a>, which you have already accepted by using Loudr. In the event of a conflict between the terms herein and any other agreements between you and Company, the terms of this Agreement shall govern. BY CLICKING BELOW THAT YOU AGREE TO THE AGREEMENT, YOU UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY AND BECOME A PARTY TO THESE TERMS, WHETHER YOU ARE ACTING IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY OR AS THE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE FOR AN ARTIST, A GROUP OR A CORPORATION, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” SHALL REFER TO THE ARTIST, GROUP OR CORPORATION ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ACTING AND AUTHORIZED TO ACT. IF YOU DO NOT UNCONDITIONALLY AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, CLICK THE “CANCEL” BUTTON. THE “EFFECTIVE DATE” OF THIS AGREEMENT IS THE DATE ON WHICH YOU CLICK THE “I AGREE” BUTTON BELOW.</p>

<p class=""digestible"">By clicking on the Accept button, you are agreeing to the terms of our Music Services Agreement. These terms supplement our Terms of Use, Copyright Policy and Privacy Policy, which you have already accepted by using Loudr.</p>

<h3 class=""heading heading-content"">Modifications To This Agreement</h3>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement from time to time by updating and posting a new version on this Website or by otherwise notifying you of the revised Agreement. By using Loudr, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the version of this Agreement that is in force during your use of the Services, as well as all applicable local, national and international laws and regulations. In the event that we make changes to this Agreement, we will provide you with the opportunity to review and approve the terms prior to use of the Services. Should any modification be unacceptable to you, your sole recourse is to discontinue use of the Services.</p>

<p class=""digestible"">Sometimes we might make minor changes to this Agreement. If we make any changes, you’ll get a chance to review and approve the terms the next time you log into Loudr. </p>

<h3 class=""heading heading-content"">What This Agreement Covers</h3>

<p>We, the Company, provide digital licensing and distribution services to content owners, as well as digital asset management services, including metadata management, catalog encoding, reporting services, and mechanical royalty clearance and administration. You, the Content Owner, are in the business of recording, producing and marketing sound recordings, musical compositions, and other intellectual property owned by you. By agreeing to these terms, you hereby warrant that you are the sole and exclusive owner of the sound recording copyright(s) and, where indicated by you, any musical compositions embodied in the sound recording copyright(s) you submit to your User Account on Loudr.</p>

<p>This Agreement covers digital distribution and other rights in and to the copyrights associated with the content you submit to your User Account on Loudr, including any and all current and future sound recordings and any underlying musical compositions embodied in the content (the “Music”). Additionally, this Agreement covers all other digital assets, including without limitation, album covers and other artwork, image files, marketing materials, trade names, trademarks, and logos, etc., that you have the right to license for commercial or promotional use (“Digital Assets”).  Together, the Music and the Digital Assets shall be referred to collectively as the Catalog (“Catalog”). You may from time to time elect to add to the Catalog by logging into your User Account on Loudr and supplying new or editing existing content, the submission of which shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p class=""digestible"">You own the music, absolutely and forever. We just distribute it, together with any related assets that you may give us, like album artwork, marketing copy or images.</p>

<h3 class=""heading heading-content"">Your Content On Loudr</h3>

<p>You hereby grant to Company the non-exclusive right and authorization to distribute, license, sell, promote, and otherwise exploit the Catalog and any and all rights in and to the sound recording(s) and underlying composition(s) within the Catalog, throughout the world as part of the Loudr platform, including any products, services, applications or platform/technical integrations offered in connection with Loudr, regardless of whether accessed through the Website or a third-party platform (“Loudr Distribution”).</p>

<p class=""digestible"">You’re giving us the non-exclusive right to sell your recordings (and original songs, if you have original songs) online as part of the Loudr platform. Most commonly, this will involve selling the music on the Loudr Website itself. It can also involve things like selling your music through an embeddable widget or letting our partners sell it through the apps they build using our API. </p>

<h3 class=""heading heading-content"">Your Content On The Rest Of The Internet</h3>

<p>You may authorize Company to distribute your Catalog or any individual album within your Catalog to any or all of the service providers, distributors, social media platforms, licensees, digital entertainment services and any other third-party services available to you through Loudr (“Third-Party Distribution”). </p>

<p>Your participation in Third-Party Distribution is optional and based on the settings selected by you in the Artist Settings section of your Loudr User Account. However, for any portion of the Catalog selected by you for Third-Party Distribution, you hereby grant to Company the sole and exclusive right and authorization to distribute, license, sell, stream, transmit, synchronize, perform, promote, and otherwise exploit such Catalog and any and all rights in and to the sound recording(s) and underlying composition(s) within such Catalog, to the extent necessary for Company to facilitate authorized Third-Party Distribution, throughout the world, in any and all media or formats now known or hereafter devised, including without limitation and where applicable through any and all digital retailers and digital entertainment services (Internet sites, mobile or online services and other entities distributing entertainment products in a digital format) and in audio and/or audiovisual works of any description, including in commercial advertisements, theatrical motion picture films, free, cable and pay per view television, video games, websites, branded content, mobile/tablet applications, and both non-interactive and interactive radio and media. Should any authorized Third-Party Distribution channel, platform, partner or service provide non-interactive radio webcasting, satellite radio, and cable subscription services, you shall grant Company the exclusive right to collect all income deriving from the Recordings as your authorized sound recording copyright owner representative, i.e. income and or levies deriving from digital, reproduction and performance uses, under statute, industry agreement or otherwise from sound recording collection bodies, if not already collected by you or your agent as of the date you authorize Third-Party Distribution under this agreement (provided, only if you give us written notice of any such prior collection arrangements promptly following the date of such authorization).   </p>

<p class=""digestible"">You can also choose to have us port your music to a variety of other music services and distribution channels, like iTunes or Spotify. These third parties may require rights above and beyond what we require for distribution on Loudr only, so if you choose to have us distribute your music through them, you also agree to give us the rights needed to carry out the distribution, and grant these rights on an exclusive basis, since the third-party services require it. </p>

<h3 class=""heading heading-content"">Additional Rights To Help Us Market and Sell Your Content</h3>

<p>Your grant of rights to Company in this Agreement shall include the right to collect, administer and distribute all revenue derived therefrom, including any advertising revenue or media revenue and revenue deriving from digital, mechanical and performance uses, under statute, industry agreement or otherwise and, if applicable, any non-interactive radio webcasting, satellite radio, and cable subscription royalties from Sound Exchange (and any other authorized organization or successor thereto) and Audio Home Recording Act royalties from the AARC (and any other authorized organization or successor thereto). All licenses shall be executed by Company as agent, and in such regard, Content Owner grants Company and its employees the right and authority to execute license agreements on its behalf during the Term. Company does not guarantee placement of the Content with any Licensee and reserves the right to reject distribution of any Content in its discretion.</p>

<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that Company may also directly market, promote, sell or otherwise exploit the Catalog through the Company’s Website and web services, as well as by way of syndication from the Company’s servers to other sellers or to consumers by way of linking, co-branded sites, widgets, data services or platform integrations. You hereby grant Company a non-exclusive, worldwide, gratis, fully paid-up and royalty-free right and license to reproduce, stream, store, publicly perform, transmit and otherwise use the Catalog, including both the Music and Digital Assets, in connection with marketing and promotion of the Catalog.</p>

<p>In addition, Company and Company’s licensees, partners, affiliates, agents and designees shall have the right to use the names, likenesses and biographical material of any artists appearing in the Content in connection with exploitation of the Content and/or the marketing and promotion thereof.  Such rights shall not include merchandising rights in anything other than the Music. Content Owner shall retain the exclusive right to commercially release and/or distribute the Content in physical format, e.g., vis-à-vis compact disc.</p>

<div class=""digestible"">
	<p>In order to distribute your music, we need to have the right to dot the I’s and cross the T’s where it is relevant. To this end, you're also giving us the right to complete all paperwork needed to collect revenue on your behalf and get you paid. </p>

	<p>You're also giving us and our partners the rights needed to market your work, such as the right to allow consumers stream samples of the music or the ability to use your name, image and bio to promote the music. </p>

	<p>But to be clear, we won't be selling anything other than what you ask us distribute through Loudr. </p>
</div>

<h3 class=""heading heading-content"">Mechanical Licensing For Your Cover Songs</h3>

<p>You may designate individual tracks within your Catalog as “Cover Songs”,0 de?ned here as any 
phonorecord eligible for licensing under Section 115 of the Copyright Act of 1976, in the Album 
Settings section of your Loudr User Account and request that Company procure mechanical and/
or digital phonorecord delivery licenses to facilitate the sale and distribution of such designated 
Cover Songs through Loudr. For any songs designated by you as Cover Songs, you hereby 
appoint Company as your authorized representative and agent in connection with the 
procurement, clearance, administration and payment of any such music publishing licenses for the 
sale and digital distribution of the Cover Songs through Loudr, whether from the Harry Fox Agency 
or any other applicable entity, provided that such publishing rights have not already been granted. 
Company shall make commercially reasonable efforts to procure the licenses prior to the sale and 
distribution of the Cover Songs hereunder, based on the information provided by you in your User 
Account, and to notify you in writing in the event that such licenses cannot be procured. Company 
shall have the right to deduct payment for any fees, costs and royalties incurred in connection with 
such licenses from the fees, royalties and proceeds otherwise payable to you. You shall solely be 
responsible for the payment of any fees and royalties that exceed the balance associated with your 
account. 
</p>

<p>Company shall make every attempt to secure the rights from the legitimate copyright holders, but shall not be responsible in the event a contracting party is ultimately determined to not hold the rights licensed by such contracting party, and Content Owner shall look solely to such contracting party for any claims in connection therewith. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement and nothing in Company’s statements to Content Owner shall be construed as a promise or guarantee about the outcome of any clearances or licenses hereunder. </p>

<div class=""digestible"">
	<p>Cover song licensing is a unique feature of Loudr that allows you to tap into our relationships with music publishers and legally release covers of your favorite songs through Loudr. If you decide to sell covers (and request cover song licensing for one or multiple songs in the Album Settings section of Loudr), you are giving us the permission to obtain the appropriate publishing licenses on your behalf. </p>

	<p>You don’t have to pay anything upfront to have us do this, but we will deduct a royalty (usually $0.091 per song download) on an ongoing basis as the songs are sold. Also, we can’t guarantee that you’ll always get the rights you want, but in the rare instance where a publisher might deny your use of the song, we’ll definitely give you a heads up. The cover song licenses do not extend to sales of music outside the Loudr ecosystem, but they most certainly do extend to sales of music through Loudr third-party platforms like iTunes.</p>
</div>

<h3 class=""heading heading-content"">The Term Of This Agreement </h3>

<p>The term (“Term”) of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date hereunder and continue:</p>

<p>a) For any individual album within the Catalog that is made available for distribution on the Loudr Website, until thirty (30) days after the date that either you, by logging into Loudr and changing your settings, or we, by sending you an email, submit a termination request to the other party; or  </p>

<p>b) For any individual album within the Catalog that is made available through Third-Party Distribution, for a mandatory period of one (1) year (“Initial Term”), followed by automatic renewal of the Agreement for consecutive one year periods (“Renewal Term”) unless that either you, by logging into Loudr and changing your settings, or we, by sending you an email, submit a termination request to the other party, no later than thirty (30) days before the end of the Initial Term or Renewal Term. The Term of this Agreement shall consist of the Initial Term together with, if applicable, the Renewal Term.</p>

<p class=""digestible"">If you’re distributing your music on Loudr only, you can quit us at any time by logging into Loudr and requesting cancellation of your account. If you have us distribute your music to third-party platforms, like iTunes or Spotify, the contract lasts for a minimum of one (1) year. If you’d like to leave the contract at the end of that time, let us know at least thirty (30) days before the end of the year.</p>

<h3 class=""heading heading-content"">Processing Your Content</h3>

<p>Within 45 days of your acceptance of these Terms and your delivery of the digital files of the Content with accurate metadata and cover artwork that fulfill the requirements set forth in the Album Settings section of your Loudr User Account, Company shall deliver the Music and applicable Digital Assets to digital entertainment services. For a current list of the services provided by Company, please log into the Loudr Website and review the Music Services page, which may be revised from time and is located at <a href=""http://loudr.fm/features"">http://loudr.fm/features</a>.</p>

<ul>

	<li>Process delivery of the Music for Third-Party Distribution, based on the selections made by you in your Loudr account. </li>
	<li>Procure licenses and collect, administer, manage and pay amounts necessary to facilitate the sale and distribution of Cover Songs, if any, through Loudr and through Third-Party Distribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may indefinitely withhold any of the Music from any store(s) of your choosing by selecting the appropriate option in Loudr no later than one week before such Music’s expected release date. You may also, after withholding Music from a particular store, select the option in Loudr to deliver the Music to such stores, at Company’s discretion.</p>

<p class=""digestible"">Within 45 days (but often much sooner) of the time you click the Agree button and deliver the assets we require for distribution, we will deliver your music to the distribution channels that you have designated in Loudr. If you change your mind later and decide to add your music to additional stores, you can modify your selection in Loudr and we’ll do our best to get the music up.</p>

<h3 class=""heading heading-content"">How We Pay You</h3>

<p>We pay you based on the percentages set forth in the Finances section of your Loudr User Account, located at <a href=""http://loudr.fm/features"">http://loudr.fm/features</a>. For any individual track or album that we distribute on your behalf, the standard Loudr Distribution percentage shall be applied to the total revenue generated by all licenses, sales and other exploitation, where shall be defined as the gross sum of fees, payments, royalties and any other consideration generated by exploitation of the Original Songs. For any individual track or album you choose to have us distribute through Third-Party Distribution, one of the following two percentages shall apply: 1) for any track which has not been designated by you as a Cover Song (“Original Songs”), the listed Third-Party Distribution percentage for Original Songs shall be applied to the total revenue generated by all licenses, sales and other exploitation of such Original Songs, and 2) for any track designated by you as a Cover Song, the listed Cover Songs percentage shall apply to all such revenue.  </p>

<p>These amounts (collectively, “Content Owner Share”) shall be calculated after deductions for licensing fees paid out to song publishing licensors, compulsory mechanical licensors, aggregators, digital retail store fees and for other marketplace costs, including without limitation conversion costs and payment processing fees (“Costs”).  Company’s payment of any sums hereunder is conditioned upon Content Owner’s fulfillment of all obligations described hereunder and receipt of Content Owner’s completed U.S. Federal Tax form W-9 or W-8BEN, as applicable, in either physical print or digital PDF format. </p>

<p>All payments of Content Owner’s Share shall be posted monthly by Company to your Artist Account page and shall be disbursed by Company to you upon your request, provided that your accrued Content Owner’s Share exceeds a threshold of ten US Dollars ($10.00 USD). Any balance due under ten U.S. dollars ($10.00 USD) (aggregated for all Licensees) shall be rolled into the following month and paid only when the balance exceeds ten U.S. dollars ($10.00 USD), or with the last statement, if applicable.</p>

<p>You are responsible for furnishing a valid tax form before any royalties will be paid. Unless other payment arrangements are made between you and Company, Company shall remit payment to you vis-à-vis PayPal or Physical Check to the address provided by you. </p>

<p>Content Owner shall have the right to appoint a certified public accountant who has signed confidentiality agreement with respect to Company’s books, to audit Company’s books and records to verify the accuracy of such statements, once with respect to any statement, once in each year, at Content Owner’s expense, at the place where Company maintains such records, during Company’s normal business hours and on at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice. All objections concerning payments hereunder shall be submitted by Content Owner within one (1) year after the date of payment, after which time all objections shall be waived. </p>

<div class=""digestible"">
	<p>Getting artists paid is something we take seriously. This is why you can view your accounting statements at any time through Loudr and request payouts whenever your total income balance reaches a minimum of $10. </p>

	<p>We pay artists a percentage of the payments we receive, based on whether the song is an original song or a cover song which requires us to pay out royalties. You can log into Loudr at any time to review the percentages and learn more about how we calculate royalties. For a quick overview, <a href=""http://loudr.fm/features"">click here</a>.</p>

<div class=""digestible"">
