Privacy Policy
We respect and protect the privacy of our users and take appropriate steps to safeguard your personal information. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") explains the types of personal information that we receive and collect when you use our Services, including but not limited to the Loudr and Bundle Dragon websites, mobiles and tablet applications.

This Privacy Policy was last updated on September 30, 2013, and is subject to revision from time to time. If we make any material changes to our policies, we will place a prominent notice on our website.

What Data We Collect

When you make a purchase on our Services, we may collect personally identifiable information that you provide to us, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, photo or nickname. We will ask you to create a password for your Loudr and Bundle Dragon accounts, and you may provide us with additional email addresses that we will link with your account. With your permission, we may also access other profile and personal information from third-party services such as Facebook and Twitter. Such information may include passwords, usernames, profile pictures, and other such data that you have posted on third-party sites and services.

The contents of any entry that you post directly to the Services, including any text, images, photos, videos and audio, are stored and maintained on our servers in order to publish these items and provide the Services. Your submitted content will be associated with your account. Our systems may also associate personal information with your activities in the course of providing Services to you (such as pages you view or things you buy).

When you send email or other communication to re:discover, Inc., we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services.

How We Use Data

We maintain and process your personal information in order to provide your account and access. We also use your name and email address to notify you of updates that you have selected in "Settings", as well as other information. Our services are also used to provide a share button. Personal information will be used to allow you to share posts through a share button, but will not be saved or stored by us. We store passwords for third-party services if it is required by that service to display the information on our Services. We do this in order to provide our Services to you. We do not store passwords for third-party sites when you provide them as part of contact information retrieval.

In addition to the above, re:discover, Inc. may process personal information for such purposes as:

Fulfilling purchases;
Sending you information related to your account or other Services;
Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our Services;
Ensuring the technical functioning of our network; and
Developing new services.

To operate the Services, we may make identifiable and anonymous information available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (1) with your express consent, (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, (3) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to protect our rights or property, or (4) to any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets. Your consent will not be required for disclosure in these cases, but we will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.
