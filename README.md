Welcome to the GitHub repository maintained by the legal team at Loudr (http://loudr.fm). 

Transparency isn’t usually the norm in the music industry, but we think it’s important to keep our community updated and for users to understand our policies. To this end, we’ve made a decision to openly share our documents and agreements, past and present, here on Github.

If you're looking for something to read, we welcome you to review these documents. The current versions of all documents can also be found under the Legal section of our site (http://loudr.fm/legal).
