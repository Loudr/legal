Transparency isn’t usually the norm in the music industry, but we think it’s important to keep our community updated and for users to understand our policies. To this end, we’ve made a decision to openly share our agreements, past and present, here on Github.

If you're looking for something to read, we welcome you to review these documents. The current versions of all documents can be found under the Legal section of our site at http://loudr.fm/legal.
