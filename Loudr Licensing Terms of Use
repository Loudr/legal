Loudr® Licensing Terms of Use.
Please carefully read the Loudr Licensing Terms of Use (“Loudr Licensing Terms”), which constitute a legally binding supplement to the Loudr Terms of Use, which you have already accepted by using the Services, and which the Loudr Licensing Terms incorporate by reference. Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Use.

1. Acceptance of Terms of Use

The Loudr Licensing Terms are a contract between you and Loudr that, together with the Loudr Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Copyright Policy, govern your use of the Loudr licensing products and services accessible at loudr.fm/licensing and under any of its subdomains or pages, along with your use of any and all applications, products, platform/technical integrations, subscriptions, application programming interfaces, graphics, audio, video, images, and any other content displayed on or accessed through loudr.fm/licensing, regardless of whether accessed through the website or a third party platform (“Loudr Licensing”).

2. Description of The Service

Loudr Licensing is a platform that enables you to purchase, using your Loudr Account, a service where we seek to secure on your behalf, at least one (1) day prior to your distribution of phonorecords, Mechanical Licenses for the reproduction and distribution of musical compositions, and administer royalty payments under the Mechanical Licenses.

In your Loudr Account, you may submit Mechanical License requests for a “Cover Song” (collectively “Cover Songs”), deﬁned here as a phonorecord embodying a musical composition that is eligible for licensing under Section 115 of the United States Copyright Act of 1976 ("Copyright Act").

By designating a recording as a Cover Song and submitting it to Loudr for licensing, you are requesting that the Loudr procure on your behalf a so-called “mechanical license” ("Mechanical License") under Section 115 of the Copyright Act, to reproduce and distribute the licensed composition as embodied in the Cover Song, in the United States of America and its territories and possessions (“Territory”). Such Mechanical License shall be limited to the formats and the quantities of reproductions designated and purchased by you in your Loudr Account. For the avoidance of doubt, any Mechanical License for physical formats will be valid only for products manufactured and distributed in the Territory. Please review the requirements for an import license under Section 1003 of the Copyright Act if you wish to distribute products that were manufactured outside the Territory, in the Territory.

3. Artist Matched Cover Songs

You may have the option to identify the composition embodied in a Cover Song by selecting the composition(s) from a list provided. For any Cover Songs matched by you in this way (“Artist Matched Cover Song”), you are requesting that the Loudr procure Mechanical License(s) for the specific musical composition(s) identified and selected by you.

4. Accuracy of Information

When you request a Mechanical License, you agree and warrant that you will provide accurate information, including song title, songwriter, publisher, track length and any other information requested for the songs that you submit to Loudr for licensing.

Furthermore, should you request a Mechanical License for an Artist Matched Cover Song, you agree and warrant that you will accurately match the song embodied in your Cover Song with a song provided in the list, or if no songs match, refrain from submitting the Cover Song as an Artist Matched Cover Song. Loudr will not not be responsible if a Mechanical License cannot be obtained, if an incorrect license is obtained, or if insufficient publisher royalties are paid as the result of inaccurate information provided by you.

5. Licensing Operations

When you request a Mechanical License, you appoint Loudr as your authorized representative and agent in connection with the procurement, clearance, administration, and payment of Mechanical Licenses for your Cover Song, whether by securing a direct license with the publisher or securing a statutory license by serving a Notice of Intent under Section 115 of the Copyright Act.

We will make commercially reasonable efforts to procure the requested Mechanical License for the Cover Song based on the information submitted by you during purchase, and to notify you in writing, either if such Mechanical License has been secured or cannot be procured, by posting an update to your Loudr Account. However, nothing in this Agreement and nothing in our statements to you shall be construed as a promise or guarantee about the outcome of any clearance or Mechanical License hereunder. While we will make every attempt to secure the rights from the legitimate copyright holders, we will not be responsible if a contracting party is ultimately determined to not hold the rights licensed by such contracting party, and you shall look solely to such contracting party for any claims therewith. In the event that any licensed composition is the subject of a takedown request from a rights holder -- for example, if a publisher chooses to invalidate your Mechanical License because the Cover Song was distributed before the Mechanical License was issued -- we will provide you with notice of the takedown request. You will no longer have permission to distribute the Cover Song under the Mechanical License.

You agree to limit your use of the musical compositions to the format and number of reproductions that Loudr has licensed on your behalf. You alone will be responsible for paying fees and royalties for formats not specified and/or reproductions exceeding the formats and quantities specified by you in your Loudr Account. You will make best efforts to include in the label copy or metadata of all recordings manufactured or distributed under the Mechanical Licenses, the names of the songwriters and publishers of the licensed compositions embodied in the recordings.

You also agree not use the Loudr Licensing to secure licenses for samples, interpolations, dramatic musical works, synchronization, public performance rights or derivative works of any kind. You must contact the relevant rights holder(s) or administrator(s) for such uses.

6. Payments

When you submit a license request on Loudr, you will be billed for the following:

a. Royalties. For interactive streams, a royalty of 1 cent per composition per stream, and for all other configurations, any royalties that must be paid to rights holders under the relevant direct license or under the U.S. Copyright Act based upon the statutory royalty rate in effect at the time of your request (currently, for digital downloads, the greater of 9.1 cents or 1.75 cents per minute per composition or fraction thereof for compositions over 5 minutes, and for ringtones, 24 cents per copy); and

b. Loudr’s licensing service fee. This covers the costs of our services, which include obtaining the Mechanical License from the appropriate copyright owner or administrator and paying that copyright owner or administrator the royalties on your behalf.

A valid credit card or bank account is required in order to submit orders through Loudr Licensing using either a live payment gateway or a third-party payment processing service. Please note that prices are subject to change at any time, and that all fees are exclusive of all federal, provincial, state, or other governmental sales, goods, and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future. Once a request for a Mechanical License has been submitted to and received by Loudr, Loudr does not provide refunds on royalties or services, except that we do refund royalties for musical compositions that we deem to be in the public domain under the Copyright Act or compositions that we deem not possible to license.

7. Content Rights

Loud is not paid for, involved with the production of, or responsible for the recordings for which Mechanical Licenses are secured through Loudr or its services. We are paid for the use of Loudr Licensing, which facilitates the licensing of content. We have registered an agent with the United States Copyright Office in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and avail the Loudr of the protections of the DMCA.

If you are a rightsholder who believes in good faith that your copyrights have been infringed through the operation of the Loudr Licensing, you can submit a takedown request in accordance with our Copyright Policy.

We shall have the right to assign this Agreement at any time to any person or entity. These Terms are binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of our respective successors and/or assigns.

Should any term of this Agreement be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or otherwise contrary to law and equity, the parties agree that such provision shall be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, severed, to the extent necessary to eliminate its invalidity or unenforceability, and that the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain unaffected.

The parties shall share equally in the costs of the mediation.
